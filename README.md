# GUI_characterization_machine
For my senior design capstone in mechanical engineering, I self-taught myself how to build interfaces with python and built my team a graphical user interface to use for the machine.
The machine collects, processes, and visualizes data from an NIDAQ device, captures imaging data and outputs live camera feed of the sample tested, and uses MATLAB engine API in python to actuate the motor slide with an arduino.
